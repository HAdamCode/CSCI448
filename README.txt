2) A3 / Android Movie Database

3) This program is designed to use the IMDB api to fetch videos based on a user search. 
	The search will allow the user to add a video to their room database where they can 
	like or dislike the movie. They can also click on the video to see more details and
	get a list of videos related to the movie such as trailers. 

4) The program should work very similarly to the demonstration video. The launch is through main activity.
	The first screen is the list screen. The top bar has a plus button to add videos to your database. 
	You can type the desired movie into the top search bar. To search, either hit the done button on the 
	keyboard or the search icon to get the list. The list is scrollable and clickable. Once you click
	a movie, a picture will show up at which point the save button will allow you to save it to the database.
	This should bring you back to the main list screen at which point you can click on the video. Hit the 
	fetch videos button to get a list of videos associated with that film. Hit the play button to be redirected
	to play the video.

5) Instructions for running the program are to hit the run button. Nothing else should be required.

6) I have spent a lot of time making sure there are no bugs so I would love any feedback if you find some. 

7) Extra Credit: The keyboard disappears when the user hits the done button, the search button or a video in the 	list
