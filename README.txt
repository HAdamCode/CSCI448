1) The navigations between screens was not very hard. It was the actual grid implementation that was difficult. 

2) I split up all of the screens into their own packages. The navigation package brought them all together. The viewmodel
also had its own package for the factory as well. All of these were in the presentation package. I also had a data
package that held the database and my entity declarations. The advantages were that everything was seperated in a way that was easy to read 
and easy to manipulate individually. Also allowed for navigation to work correctly. 

3) No extra credit. Hard enough as it was.
